Make a 'Contribution rules' doc

We are all volonteers here. We devote personal time to this project for the benefit of the community at-large. We just don't have the time to deal with difficult people: don't be an a**hole.

We are a small focused team. We must reject RFPs that are too large in scope, e.g. full refactoring, addition of a significant features requiring architectural or mental model change. In such case, please fork and prove it. Then we will be happy to discuss. We are not fully risk adverse, but we have to protect our users. This applies to the wiki as well: any large scale reorg must be thoroughly discussed between editors and agreed by consensus.

Request for features or addressing bugs that are vague, poorly written, incomplete or hard to understand, might get closed without comment. If you feel free to be rude enough to make little effort to be understood, we won't feel rude to close the door.


MAKE RULES APPLY TO WIKI AS WELL AS CODE -- TODO
